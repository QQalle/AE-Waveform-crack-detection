# AE-Waveform-crack-detection
AE-Waveform-Crack-Detection is a project developed by three students at Link√∂ping University (LiU) as part of their Bachelor's Thesis in Mechanical Engineering. The objective of this project is to detect matrix cracks in carbonfiber-reinforced-polymers using Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques.

The project utilizes data captured using the AEwin software by Mistras Group/Physical Acoustics. The captured data, along with the MATLAB code, figures, and graphs, are available in the repository for reference and further analysis.
